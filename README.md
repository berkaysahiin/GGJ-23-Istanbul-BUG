# GGJ-23 Istanbul @BUG

Theme: Root

It's a card-strategy game where you try to create a forest from a mother tree. During the day people come to cut down the trees, while at night we try to 
defend our forest by adding new trees and forest creatures with the oxygen we accumulate to defend our forest. 

Controls: Drag and Drop
